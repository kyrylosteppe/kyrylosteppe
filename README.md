### Hi, I’m @kyrylosteppe 👋

👋 Hello! My name is Kyrylo, and I'm a terrible programmer, but you know what? I don’t plan on staying that way.  

🚀 I'm getting better by sharing my experiences—both positive and negative—with you.  

🧠 Learning from both my own and others' mistakes, while programming a lot in C++, because it's awesome!  

🤝 Looking for collaboration opportunities to work on interesting and challenging projects.  

📫 How to reach me: Say hello here on GitHub and follow my progress. I promise there will be a lot of interesting stuff! 😊  

😄 Pronouns: He/Him
